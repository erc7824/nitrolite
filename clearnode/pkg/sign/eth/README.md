# Ethereum Signing Package (`eth`)

This package provides an implementation of the `sign` interfaces for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.

It handles all Ethereum-specific cryptographic details, such as Keccak256 hashing, ECDSA `secp256k1` keys, and signature recovery.


## Usage

See the Go package documentation and examples by running:
```bash
go doc -all github.com/erc7824/nitrolite/clearnode/pkg/sign/eth
```

Or view examples in your IDE or on pkg.go.dev.
