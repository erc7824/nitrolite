# Nitrolite Protocol — On-Chain and Off-Chain Architecture

## High-level goal

Nitrolite is an **extended state-channel protocol** that enables:

* continuous off-chain transfers and application interactions,
* frequent on-chain settlement (deposit / withdrawal),
* cross-chain liquidity movement (bridging),
* without locking all funds until channel closure.

The protocol trades atomic cross-chain guarantees for **optimistic enforcement with challenge recovery**, relying on cryptographic authorization and game-theoretic incentives.

---

## Core abstraction: Cross-Chain Token Balance (CCTB) State

A **channel** between a **User** and a **Node** is represented by a monotonically increasing sequence of **Cross-Chain States**.

Each state:

* has a strictly increasing `version`,
* is signed by both User and Node,
* encodes the net result of:

  * on-chain operations (deposit / withdrawal / migration),
  * off-chain transfers,
  * off-chain application sessions,
  * escrow preparation and execution.

A state may refer to **multiple chains**, but at any time only **at most two per-chain sub-states** exist (home and non-home).

Each **per-chain sub-state** represents accounting on a specific chain and consists of:

* **absolute allocations**
  (`userAllocation`, `nodeAllocation`) that must be fully backed by collateral locked on that chain, and

* **cumulative net flows**
  (`userNetFlow`, `nodeNetFlow`) that encode the aggregate effect of deposits, withdrawals, off-chain transfers, and app-session lock/unlock events since channel creation.

The difference between successive states’ net flows determines how much value must be pulled from or pushed to each party during on-chain enforcement.

---

## Off-chain protocol (control plane)

### Participants

* **User** — owns funds and initiates actions.
* **Node (Broker)** — provides liquidity, routing, and coordination.

### Off-chain responsibilities

The off-chain protocol is responsible for:

1. **State construction**

   * The Node aggregates:

     * off-chain transfers,
     * app-session lock/unlock events,
     * pending on-chain actions.
   * These are netted into a new `State` by updating per-chain allocations and cumulative net flows.

2. **State authorization**

   * Both User and Node sign the full state:

     ```
     (channelId, version, intent, homeState, nonHomeState)
     ```
   * A party **never signs two different states with the same version**.

3. **Liquidity enforcement (Node responsibility)**

   * The Node must ensure it has enough liquidity to back absolute allocations:

     * between normal operations,
     * except during explicitly allowed escrow or migration phases.
   * If liquidity drops below a threshold, the User may:

     * checkpoint the latest state on-chain,
     * withdraw,
     * or migrate the channel.

4. **Flow control**

   * When a cross-chain escrow or migration is in progress:

     * the Node **stops issuing new states**,
     * until the process completes or is challenged.

5. **Optimistic bridging**

   * Cross-chain actions are **not atomically verifiable** on-chain.
   * Correctness is ensured by:

     * signed states,
     * cumulative net-flow accounting,
     * timeouts,
     * challenge rights.

---

## Off-chain actions encoded in states

### Off-chain transfers

* When a User **sends** funds off-chain:

  * user allocation decreases,
  * node net flow increases.
* When a User **receives** funds off-chain:

  * user allocation increases,
  * node net flow decreases.

These changes are reflected only in cumulative net flows until enforced on-chain.

---

### Off-chain application sessions

* App sessions are off-chain sub-channels governed by an external server.
* Funds may be:

  * **locked** into a session (flow to Node),
  * **unlocked** from a session (flow to User).
* Only signatures are required for persistence.
* Session effects are netted into cumulative net flows of the next enforceable state.

---

## On-chain protocol (enforcement plane)

The on-chain contract is the **final arbiter** of correctness.

It does not reconstruct intent — it **verifies and enforces signed states** by:

* validating signatures and monotonic versioning,
* applying the delta between the last enforced state and the submitted state,
* pulling or pushing funds according to net-flow differences,
* updating locked collateral to match absolute allocations.

---

## Channel lifecycle (on-chain)

### 1. Channel creation

* A channel is created with an initial signed state:

  * version = 0,
  * intent = CREATE,
  * funds pulled from the User (home chain).
* Channel enters `OPERATING`.

---

### 2. Normal operation (OPERATING)

While operating:

* Any **newer signed state** may be enforced on-chain.
* Enforcement may:

  * pull funds from User,
  * push funds to User,
  * lock or unlock Node liquidity.
* Enforcement may occur for:

  * deposit,
  * withdrawal,
  * checkpoint,
  * escrow execution,
  * migration execution.

Off-chain activity can continue indefinitely between enforcements.

---

### 3. Deposit (single-chain)

* User signs a state with intent = DEPOSIT.
* User net flow becomes positive.
* On enforcement:

  * funds are pulled from User,
  * locked into the channel.

---

### 4. Withdrawal (single-chain)

* User signs a state with intent = WITHDRAW.
* User net flow becomes negative.
* On enforcement:

  * funds are pushed to User,
  * channel locked funds decrease.

---

### 5. Checkpoint

* A state with intent = OPERATE.
* User net flow delta must be zero.
* Used to:

  * acknowledge off-chain transfers,
  * clear challenges,
  * synchronize cumulative net-flow accounting.

---

## Challenge mechanism (optimistic safety)

### Purpose

Challenges protect against:

* submission of outdated states,
* malicious or crashed counterparties,
* incomplete cross-chain operations.

---

### Challenge rules

* Only channels in `OPERATING` can be challenged.
* A challenge references a signed state.
* If the challenged state is **older than the latest signed state**:

  * the newest valid signed state **must be enforced first**, regardless of its intent.

Invariant:

> Dispute resolution always requires processing the newest valid signed state, even if that state represents escrow execution or migration rather than deposit or withdrawal.

---

### Resolving a challenge

* Any party may submit a **strictly newer signed state**.
* If valid:

  * it is enforced,
  * net-flow deltas are applied,
  * the challenge is cleared,
  * channel returns to `OPERATING`.

---

### Challenge timeout

* If no newer state is submitted before expiry:

  * channel may be closed unilaterally,
  * allocations are paid out according to the last enforced state.

---

## Channel closure

A channel can be closed:

1. **Cooperatively**

   * via a signed CLOSE state.

2. **Unilaterally**

   * after a challenge expires.

Closure:

* pushes all remaining allocations to User and Node,
* sets channel status to CLOSED.

---

## Cross-chain operations (bridging)

Cross-chain actions are **two-phase** and **optimistic**.

### Why two-phase?

Because:

* one chain cannot directly observe or verify another chain’s state,
* atomic enforcement is impossible without foreign-chain verification.

The protocol deliberately does **not** rely on light clients (on-chain verification of foreign headers, proofs, and validator signatures), as they are complex, expensive, and chain-specific.

The two phases are:

1. **Preparation phase**

   * liquidity is locked on chains where needed,
   * an escrow object (possible with timeouts) is created,
   * Node stops issuing new states.

2. **Execution phase**

    * an execution state that updates allocations and net flows is issued and signed
    * this state may be enforced immediately or later, but is enforceable to resolve disputes.

---

## Escrow deposit (bridging in)

### Preparation phase

* User locks funds on the **non-home chain**.
* Node locks equal liquidity on the **home chain**.
* An escrow object with timeouts is created.

---

### Execution phase

* A signed execution state updates allocations and net flows:

  * User’s non-home allocation decreases,
  * Node’s home allocation decreases,
  * corresponding net flows encode the swap.

This execution state **may be enforced immediately or later**, but must be enforceable to resolve disputes.

---

## Escrow withdrawal (bridging out)

### Preparation phase

* Node locks withdrawal liquidity on the **non-home chain**.

---

### Execution phase

* Signed state updates allocations and net flows so that:

  * User receives funds on the non-home chain.

If enforcement stalls:

* challenges and timeouts guarantee completion or reversion.

---

## Escrow Challenge Resolution

If an escrow process is challenged (status becomes `DISPUTED`) and the challenge period expires (`challengeExpireAt` passed) without a resolution:

*   The `finalize` function handles this case explicitly.
*   If called when `DISPUTED` and expired:
    1.  Do **not** invoke the channel engine.
    2.  Manually **unlock the locked funds to the Node**.
    3.  Zero out `lockedFunds` and `challengeExpireAt`.
    4.  Set status to `FINALIZED`.
    5.  Emit a finalization event.

This logic mirrors the channel closure mechanism: if a challenge is not substantiated by a newer state within the timeout, the system defaults to a finalized state that releases locked resources.

---

## Home chain migration

Migration enables moving the channel's "home" security chain from one blockchain to another, preserving allocations and cumulative accounting.

Like other cross-chain operations, migration is **two-phase** and **optimistic**.

---

### Preparation phase (INITIATE_MIGRATION)

The preparation phase establishes the channel on the target (non-home) chain:

* A preparation state is constructed with:
  * intent = INITIATE_MIGRATION,
  * non-home state where Node deposits liquidity equal to User's allocation on the home chain.

**On the non-home chain:**

* This state is submitted via `initiateMigration()`.
* Effect:
  * creates a channel on the non-home chain with status `MIGRATING_IN`,
  * locks Node's funds on the non-home chain.
* Implementation note: States are swapped before storing to maintain the invariant that `homeState` represents the current chain.

**On the home chain:**

* The preparation state **can be submitted** via `initiateMigration()`:
  * updates the channel's latest state,
  * keeps the channel in `OPERATING` status,
  * can clear a challenge (following standard challenge resolution flow).
* The preparation state **cannot be checkpointed** via `checkpoint()`:
  * `checkpoint()` explicitly rejects states with migration intents.
* The home-chain channel **can be challenged** with a preparation state:
  * this enables dispute resolution if something goes wrong,
  * a valid FINALIZE_MIGRATION execution state can move the channel from `DISPUTED` to `MIGRATED_OUT`,
  * otherwise, after `challengeExpireAt`, funds may be withdrawn according to standard challenge rules.

---

### Execution phase (FINALIZE_MIGRATION)

The execution phase completes the migration by swapping home and non-home roles:

* An execution state is constructed that:
  * swaps the `homeState` and `nonHomeState` from the preparation phase,
  * swaps allocations between User and Node in each state,
  * intent = FINALIZE_MIGRATION.

**On the old home chain:**

* This state is submitted via `finalizeMigration()`:
  * releases Node liquidity on the old home chain,
  * moves the channel to `MIGRATED_OUT` status,
  * can clear a challenge (moving from `DISPUTED` to `MIGRATED_OUT`).
* Implementation note: States are swapped before validation to maintain the invariant that `homeState` represents the current chain.

**On the new home chain** (old non-home chain):

* The execution state **may be submitted explicitly** via `finalizeMigration()`:
  * moves the channel from `MIGRATING_IN` to `OPERATING`.
* However, the **intended usage** is to combine the execution phase with a subsequent operation:
  * any on-chain call (deposit, withdrawal, checkpoint, escrow initiate/finalize, or close) can be applied **on top of** the execution phase state,
  * this implicitly completes the migration and transitions the channel to `OPERATING`.
* The new home chain can be challenged with the execution state (or any newer valid state), triggering normal challenge resolution.

---

### Migrating back

A channel on a chain with status `MIGRATED_OUT` can be migrated back:

* Submitting a new preparation phase state via `initiateMigration()` on that chain:
  * moves the channel from `MIGRATED_OUT` to `MIGRATING_IN`,
  * initiates a reverse migration flow.

This enables round-trip migration as needed.

---

### Implementation: State Representation and Delta Calculation

Migration presents a unique challenge for on-chain implementation: **which state represents the current chain changes during migration**.

#### The Problem

The protocol describes migration as swapping `homeState` and `nonHomeState` roles, but this creates semantic ambiguity for on-chain validation:

1. **Preparation phase on non-home chain**: Actions (node deposits liquidity) are encoded in `nonHomeState`, but after the channel is created, subsequent operations must calculate deltas from this state—even though validation logic assumes `homeState` represents the current chain.

2. **Execution phase on old home chain**: After the user swaps states in the execution phase state, `nonHomeState` represents the old home (current chain), but validation logic expects `homeState` to represent the current chain.

3. **Delta calculation inconsistency**: After `INITIATE_MIGRATION` on the non-home chain creates a `MIGRATING_IN` channel, the next operation (e.g., deposit) cannot correctly calculate deltas because the previous state's allocations are in `nonHomeState`, not `homeState`.

#### The Solution: Context-Based Validation + Selective State Swapping

To maintain the invariant that **homeState always represents the chain where execution happens**, the implementation uses:

**1. Two Migration Intents with Context-Based Behavior:**

* `INITIATE_MIGRATION`: Single intent used on both home and non-home chains
* `FINALIZE_MIGRATION`: Single intent used on both old home and new home chains

The same signed state can be submitted on both chains. The contract determines the correct behavior based on the channel status:
* INITIATE_MIGRATION + status VOID/MIGRATED_OUT → non-home chain behavior (create MIGRATING_IN)
* INITIATE_MIGRATION + status OPERATING/DISPUTED → home chain behavior (update state)
* FINALIZE_MIGRATION + status MIGRATING_IN → new home chain behavior (move to OPERATING)
* FINALIZE_MIGRATION + status OPERATING/DISPUTED → old home chain behavior (move to MIGRATED_OUT)

**2. Four ChannelsHub Functions:**

* `initiateMigration()`: Called on non-home chain to create `MIGRATING_IN` channel
* `initiateMigration()`: Called on home chain to update state
* `finalizeMigration()`: Called on new home chain to move `MIGRATING_IN` → `OPERATING`
* `finalizeMigration()`: Called on old home chain to release funds and move to `MIGRATED_OUT`

All functions accept the same intents (INITIATE_MIGRATION or FINALIZE_MIGRATION), allowing the same signed state to be used on both chains.

**2. Selective State Swapping (only where needed):**

* **`INITIATE_MIGRATION` (on new home chain)**: Swap `homeState` ↔ `nonHomeState` before storing
  * Incoming state has actions in `nonHomeState` (new home = current chain)
  * After swap, stored state has actions in `homeState` (current chain)
  * Result: Next operation calculates deltas correctly from `homeState`

* **`FINALIZE_MIGRATION` (on old home chain)**: Swap `homeState` ↔ `nonHomeState` before validation
  * Incoming state (after user swaps) has old home actions in `nonHomeState` (current chain)
  * After swap, validation sees actions in `homeState` (current chain)
  * Result: Validation and fund release logic work correctly

* **No swap needed** for `INITIATE_MIGRATION` (on old home chain) and `FINALIZE_MIGRATION` (on new home chain) (homeState already represents current chain)

**3. Special Delta Calculation for `FINALIZE_MIGRATION` (on new home chain):**

When finalizing migration on the new home chain, the previous state (from `INITIATE_MIGRATION`) has allocations in `nonHomeState` (before swap) but was swapped when stored. Delta calculation must account for this:

```solidity
delta = candidate.homeState.netFlow - prevStoredState.homeState.netFlow
```

This works because `prevStoredState` was swapped during `INITIATE_MIGRATION`.

#### Implementation Notes

* Signatures are validated **before** swapping (using the original signed state)
* After swapping, signatures are invalidated (`userSig = ""`, `nodeSig = ""`) to prevent misuse
* The swapped state is only used internally for storage and validation
* Events emit the original signed state (before swap) for off-chain observability
* This approach maintains the critical invariant: **ChannelEngine always sees homeState as the current chain**

---

## Security model summary

* **Authorization**: all state changes require valid signatures.
* **Monotonicity**: `version` strictly increases.
* **Replay resistance**: no two states with the same version can coexist.
* **Liquidity safety**: absolute allocations must be collateral-backed.
* **Optimistic safety**:

  * challenges always resolve by enforcing the newest valid state,
  * stalled cross-chain operations can always be completed or reverted.

---

## Mental model

* Off-chain protocol **decides what should happen**.
* On-chain contract **enforces the latest authorized accounting state**.
* Bridging is **non-atomic but recoverable**.
* The channel is **continuously enforceable**, not locked until closure.
