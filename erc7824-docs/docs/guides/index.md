## Guide Categories

### Getting Started
For developers new to Nitrolite, we recommend starting with our [Quick Start](/quick_start) guide, which covers the fundamental concepts and basic implementation.

### Migration & Upgrades
The [Migration Guide](migration-guide) provides detailed information about breaking changes between versions and how to update your code accordingly. This is essential reading when upgrading your Nitrolite dependencies.

### Coming Soon

We're continuously expanding our documentation. Future guides will include:

- **Best Practices**: Optimization techniques and design patterns for state channel applications
- **Security Guide**: Security considerations and audit recommendations
- **Performance Tuning**: Maximizing throughput and minimizing latency
- **Integration Examples**: Real-world examples of integrating Nitrolite with popular frameworks
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions
