# Auto-Generated Test Artifacts

⚠️ **DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES MANUALLY** ⚠️

This directory contains auto-generated TypeScript files that export contract ABIs and bytecode for use in integration tests. These files are generated from the compiled smart contracts in `contract/out/`.

## Generation Process

Test artifacts are automatically generated by running:

```bash
# Generate all artifacts (ABIs + test artifacts)
npm run codegen

# Generate only test artifacts  
npm run codegen:test
```

The generation script is located at `scripts/generate-test-artifacts.ts`.

## Source of Truth

The source of truth for these artifacts is the Solidity contracts in the `contract/` directory. When contracts are updated:

1. Compile contracts using Foundry in the `contract/` directory
2. Run `npm run codegen` in the SDK directory to regenerate artifacts

## Artifacts Included

- **`custody.ts`** - Generated from `Custody.sol/Custody`
- **`dummy.ts`** - Generated from `Dummy.sol/Dummy`  
- **`testERC20.ts`** - Generated from `TestERC20.sol/TestERC20`

## Usage in Tests

These artifacts are imported by the test setup in `setup.ts`:

```typescript
import { CustodyArtifacts } from './artifacts/custody';
import { DummyArtifacts } from './artifacts/dummy';
import { TestERC20Artifacts } from './artifacts/testERC20';
```

## Benefits of Auto-Generation

1. **Consistency** - Always in sync with compiled contracts
2. **Maintenance** - No manual updates needed when contracts change
3. **Type Safety** - Proper TypeScript types for ABIs and bytecode
4. **CI/CD Ready** - Can be integrated into build pipelines

## Troubleshooting

If artifacts seem outdated:

1. Ensure contracts are compiled in `contract/` directory
2. Run `npm run clean` to remove old artifacts
3. Run `npm run codegen` to regenerate everything
